Visual product placement techniques in retail stores could also be applied to development team’s bookshelves <sup>[(1)](#fnOne)</sup>: 
* Eye level: must read books like McConnell's Code Complete, Uncle Bob’s Clean Code, M. Fowler’s Refactoring, etc.
* Higher level: expert books like machine learning, AI, etc.
* Lower level: expiring books <sup>[(2)](#fnTwo)</sup> like frameworks, tools, etc.

Bookshelves could also be placed at the entrance and exit from the team’s area. Every time a team member walks in and out she/he is reminded about what’s crucial, what’s relatively important and what’s less important or temporary.

In Finland, cheap wines are placed on the lower level shelves, medium price are located on eye level, and expensive wines are placed at the top shelves. You will also find more medium price wines than the other two categories. On a special occasion, you’ll probably buy an expensive wine and, if you want to mix it<sup>[(3)](#fnThree)</sup> or cook with it, you’ll probably go with a cheap one (recommended, but not mandatory). But most of the time you’ll find something from the medium shelves that will suit your needs. Same for the books.

I find it very interesting when I see “must read” books placed on the lower level shelves, like cheap wines. I have the feeling that eye level books will tell you what the development teams are good at. Do the experiment yourself: go to your team’s bookshelf and check what’s on eye level; then cross check with what your team is good at. You can tweet me your results at @gborobio.

<a name="fnOne">(1)</a> This is a very short list and it's missing important books, but you get my idea.<br> 
<a name="fnTwo">(2)</a> These kind of books get outdated when a new version of the framework or tool is released.<br> 
<a name="fnThree">(3)</a> Try to mix it with cola, we call it “kalimotxo” and [it works](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/dining/wine-and-cola-it-works.html).
